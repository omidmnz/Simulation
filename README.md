# Simulation
This repository contains the drafts of a series of lecture notes on simulation
of stochastic processes.

The notes are written in the Jupyter notebook format. We will
use [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for most of our
computations, [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) for
graph processing and visualization, [Matplotlib]() for general data
visualization, and [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) when it comes handy.
